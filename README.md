Hi :wave:

In this repository, I used Car Features and MSRP dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).

I used PySpark for this project. First of all, I used queries on the data. Then I determined outliers and display the data by data visualization. After outlier treatment,
I created Machine Learning pipeline. In this process, I used;

:pen: StringIndexer

:pen: OneHotEncoderEstimator

:pen: VectorAssembler

:pen: Pipeline

:pen: Cross Validator

:pen: Random Forest Regressor

:pen: Evaluation


Thank you :tulip:
